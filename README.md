hi there ðŸ‘‹

originally wanted to pursue **multimedia or fine arts**, but somehow ended up in compsci.  
no regrets... probably.  

**cowpillar**/**cheu** is a pseudonymâ€”most of my projects are private or tied to my IRL work,  
so i can't really share them ðŸ˜ž  

i do, however, post some projects here from time to time,  
mostly **software** or **game development** stuff!
